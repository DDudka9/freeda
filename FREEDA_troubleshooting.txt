GENERAL RULES:

# remeber to always name the proteins by their gene names
# remeber to ALWAYS use coding sequence and exons corresponding to the GENEID in ensembl (exons MUST be identical to gene for "find_exons" function to work)
# its best to use the same uniprot aa sequence for blasting as the ensembl cds




DISPLAY:

# Clasp1 genome3 is good for find exons function display

# Hamming function (duplications) display - Sgo2a in Caroli -> chr1_for and chr8_rev are duplications (Sgo2a and Sgo2b) -> humming distance worked to distinguish
# or Sgo2a Pahari - chr19 (Sgo2b) and chr5 (Sgo2a) - same as ensembl

# Display of hamming distance function and synteny check -> Cep170 genome1

# DISPLAY -> Cdc16 genome 1 -> all 18 exons are retreived

# Problem: Cdk5rap2 exon-intron boundery "in frame" causes frameshift via gBlocks:
# Cdk5rap2 has a frameshift in middle-C-term in whole MSA (including Mm)  -> still doesnt score as adaptive

# Cause:
# Ms has 26 and 27 exons missing (Ns) and is off by 1bp in alignment but the deletion is %3 == 0 so it thinks its in frame
# so gBlocks fails
# its not scoring in PAML cose every sequence is frameshifted the same way for a stretch of almost 240aa
# Need to implement a function checking Mm uniprot vs post-gBlocks translation of Mm
# if non-syn detected -> delete the post-gBlocks sequence that is out of frame in whole MSA
# then run PAML on the remaining part -> log the deletion (use Cdk5rap2 Ms chr4_1_rev exon 25 ending and 28 beginning (missing 26 and 27))
# basically the last bp in exon 25 (G) is glued to beginning of exon 28 in while MSA but deletion is 228bp ("in frame") so Frameshift is not triggered
# and therefore gBlocks thinks its all in frame -> introduces a frameshift in whle MSA when trimming the edges of the deletion

# Solution:
# checkpoint of uniprot Mm with the post-gBlocks Mm cds -> delete frameshifts before PAML

# vs v43 -> added check for insertion (needs to have locus[position != "-"])
# vs v43 -> increased the threshold to 40% of match identity from blast (Aurkb and Ttk kinases had >300 matches with 30% threshold)


# THE CODE CAN APPARENTLY RETREIVE WELL THE CDS (Pd_CENP-T the same as manual)
#  -> except for a small deletion in automatic CDS (dashes) that was manually removed in my original analysis
#  -> also Gd_CENP-T contig 1386593 misses piece of N-term in exon 1 and shows non-intronic exon 2 which is not true

# some contigs have non-0 RETRO score cose of C-term introny but possible retro at N-term (usually cose of N-term intron misalignment/deletion) -> looks like ("only C-term")

# Although Mad1l1 gene is enormous (300kb) and its very slow to align even with 15kb contig threshold
# it seems that lowering the threshold to 15kb did not speed up the alignment -> best to get back to 30kb
# its most likely because of the gene itself (300kb) that the alignment takes 1.5h per species
# the code seems to be able to retreive proper exons from each genome
# therefore best strategy will be to simply run all such big proteins separately 
# these slow alignment files need to be converted to "CLUSTAL" format in unipro "project" view

# N-terms missing (so whole exons missing):

    # Dlgap5 genome3 - 560691__rev exon 17
    
# OLD COMMENT (not sure if still valid as of v45)
	# Haus2 RATTUS - frameshift detected in exon5 (out of 6) -> 3 del and 2 ins but only 2 ins are real (dels are at exon edge)
	# CHECK THAT -> THE CDS SHOULD NOT BE CLONED BUT IT IS!!!!!
	# same for Sgo2 Mo (here there are Ns in most of exon 6)
	
# OLD COMMENT (not sure if still valid as of v45)
	# check exons ex. Haus3 -> check carefully exon junctions before and after Gblocks

# OLD COMMENT (not sure if still valid as of v45)
	# So far Dlgap5, Haus1, Haus3, Haus5 and Haus8 pass >5.99 LRT for M8 v M7
	# only Haus3 passes both M2a v M1a and M8 v M7 (maybe cose its the largest)
	# my previous ref based assembly based PAML detected pos sel in Haus1, 4, 5, 6
	# however it had few Haus3 and Haus8 sequences and Haus6 was PRANK aligned
	# check why Haus4 is not consistent (99% seq, 12 species but no pos sel)

# OLD COMMENT (not sure if still valid as of v45)
	# Cenpk An NC_047676.1_rev contig exon 3 not intronic cose of >3 dashes in gene on both ends

# OLD COMMENT (not sure if still valid as of v45)
	# Something weird in Kif4 Spicilegus (QGOO01034972.1__for) -> huge insertion in exon 12 (not cloned)
	# and shows exon 31 and 32 while there is only 30 exons in Kif4


**** DONE ****
# FRAMESHIFT detecting function -> long genes have high chance of single exons aligning
# erroneously -> causing frameshifts (Clasp1 Spicilegus) -> fix that
# The code recognized 38 exons instead of 39 exons and all exons were shifted -> causing fake frameshift
# somewhere between exon 26 and 27
# FIXED (microexons function) -> skips the microexon (but mind you that exon numbers are also changed)


**** DONE ****
# Clasp1 SURDASTER contig NW_021604620.1__rev -> all exons found but it says "CDS not in frame"
# ITS BECAUSE these genes are too long for single exon alignment and cloning -> they misalign
# to fix it I might need to:
    # 1) either clone exons directly from the first alignment (time efficient)
        # -> ex. if gene length >= 100kb clone clone exons without overhangs
    # 2) DO THIS !!!!! or maybe its even better to modify the cloning exon function to cut the underlying gene fragment and align the exon + overhangs onto it (instead of the whole gene)

**** DONE ****
# the best way to deal with microexons is to simply scan Mm_exons for microexons and cut them out
# preserving continuity of 1->x exons without skipping numbers (Done)

**** DONE ****
# Clasp1 alignemnt ended up with many STOP codons within CDS
# -> there are dashes in Mm cds
# -> maybe make MAFFT not leave single dashes?

**** DONE ****
# add a checkpoint of the final original species cds translation (also "corrected") to original species ensembl coding sequence (not uniprot as these may (rarely) be tiny different)

**** DONE ****
# Cep250 ensembl 202 has a microexon 12 of size 17bp (passes my 15bp threshold) and leads to massive missalignment
# I need to raise the threshold to 20bp at least (sequences with 21bp exons were aligned well)
# Cep250 has alternative transcript (201) that has a longer exon 12 -> use that instead but need to run blast again

**** NOT SURE IF FIXED ****
# Cep250 genome15 exon10 has a clear deletion in C-term that misaligns in final MSA giving dashes to original species -> again correction function fails


# Aspm genome1 1439113_rev exon 3 has a 1bp deletion -> frameshift and not cloned (ok i think)


**** DONE ****
# correction function needs fixing -> it only eliminates one dash column based on Mm
# use Oip5 to fix that
# also it might be good to clone Frameshifts as well -> Oip5 has meaningful frameshifts in exon 5

# Problem: Cdk5rap2 exon-intron boundery "in frame" causes frameshift via gBlocks:

# eliminate_all_insertions works well for Cep250


**** DONE ****
    # I RELAXED INTRONY FROM "and" to "or" - 12_15_2020
    # TOO RELAXED -> make pos5 -> 1 or pos12 -> 3 -> DONE (to be tested; 12_16_2020)
    # THATS BETTER -> but still too relaxed -> try pos6 -> 1 or pos12 -> 3
    # Still getting some fake introny -> Haus6 genome7 -> '1244393__rev' contig has
    # 2 good intronic exons and one fake -> loses to 953665__for because of fake exon
    # (they should not compete with one another) -> try pos7 -> 1 or pos12 -> 3
    
    # still (01_05_2021) introny too strict for Dlgap5 Rattus exon 7 (>= 4/16 will be enough)
    # same for Haus4 Pahari (>= 4/16 should be enough)
    
    # Haus8 Gs exon2 intronic only N-term WRONG (3/13 rule too permissive)
    #   -> modify find exon function to reject exons that contains >60bp insertions:
        # cds == "-" and gene == "-" and locus != "-" for more than 60bp
    
    # HOW TO DEAL WITH DASHES? -> nothing, counts as mismatch

**** DONE ****
    # some genes (like Mad1l1 are very large >300kb with some introns of up to 70kb) -> which slows MAFFT alignment very significantly
    # but the contigs can still assemble a final cds well even if broken down by 30kb limit
    # especially that Mad1l1 has mulitple large introns of >10kb that all go to one contig
    # breaking down contigs to <15kb would help
    # 01/18/2021 -> I changed the limit to 15kb -> IT RUN EVEN LONGER!
    # most likely due to 300kb gene -> more contigs run longer even if they are shorter
    # smaller piece (200bp) from blast aligns much longer than longer piece (1000bp) with longer contig
    
    # TEST WHAT HAPPENS WITH MAD1 WITH 50kb LIMIT
    
03_15_2021 (v52)

# ***** REVIEW OF THE v46 version (leading to v52):
    
# very often 200bp synteny cap was too long (<100bp) so synteny wasnt called

# Anapc15 SPRET chr10 exon 5 -> N-term is RETRO but its not called that cose
# C-term is INTRONIC -> but still RETRO_score is high and contig is discarded

# Anapc10 ARVICANTHIS NC_047675.1__for -> exon4 is only N-term intronic due to a large insertion in 3UTR
# but maybe I should let synteny check in all potential last exons and if syntenic -> then also intronic
# DONE

# I added a check that does not reject an insertion in last exons
# DONE

# Anapc11 genome1 1177822__for last exon (2) -> fails C-term introny check cose cannot reach 0.80 (but looks intronic)
# SOLUTION: check synteny every time at last exon (computationally expensive) or decrease homology to 0.75 (maybe extend to 20bp)
# DONE -> currently check introny function runs on 0.75 homology threshold and 50bp min stretch (v52)

# I added a call for introny when rolling hd gets to the end of the extension
# test on Anapc11 genome5 977531__rev exon 2 (not intronic despite apparent N-term introny probably cose C-term introny is "None" rather than "False")
# SOLUTION: reduce homology to 0.75 and lift the 15bp check to 20bp (finally lifted to 50bp in v52)
# FIXED

# testing PAML on v47 -> Anapc11 has only 11 species as compared to 14 species in v45
# Anapc11 genome1 -> 117782 falsely not intronic cose C-term not intronic (11/15) falsely (why N-term called not intronic?)
# FIXED

# Anapc10 -> same between v45 and v47
# Anapc13 -> same number of species but 100% sequence compared to 97% in v45 (CHECK SPRET ERRONEOUS EXON FROM v45)
# Anapc16 -> v47 gives all 14 species while v45 only 12
# FIXED

# Anapc10 ARVICANTHIS contig NC_047675.1__for -> exon 4 intronic only N-term (cose deletion in 3UTR makes it have more than 10 indels in rolling_introny and synteny never checked)
# SOLUTION: if its the last exon -> check synteny first and only then introny
# FIXED

# v49 prints C-term synteny message before last exon introny is called 
# implemented -> good

# Anapc16 RATTUS NC_005119.4__rev -> exon 3 is falsely not intronic (very divergent introns -> <= 10/40 check would pick it up)
# same for Anapc16 genome5 1009636__rev (10/40 would fix it)
# FIXED (v52 runs homology check on non-intronic exons)

# v51
# Anapc1 ARVICANTHIS NC_047659.1__rev exon 12 -> not intronic cose it falls below 0.66 at N-term and has huge intron insertion at C-term
# SOLUTION: v45 picked it up as C-term introny -> modify check_introny function extending min_stretch to 50bp
# still not fixed -> Anapc1 genome3 contig 503241__for exon 12 not intronic cose N-term intron very divergent (not even 50bp stetch helped)
# SOLUTION2: dont count dashes at all -> count till cds != "-" then break
# still not fixed -> for Anapc1 genome3 contig 503241__for exon 12 (not intronic)
# SOLUTION3: extend the allowed_indels variable to 20bp (17 dashes in locus of Anapc1 genome3 contig 503241__for exon 12)
# FIXED by extending min stretch to 50bp in homology check and running it at all non-intronic exons that are not first and last (risks of not syntenic contigs)

# Anapc13 SPRET chrX and chrX_1 and chr17 have non-syntenic (by eye) but syntenic by current introny rules contigs
# these are probably some duplications -> but chr17 was cloned as true exon1 cose chr9 (true locus according to ensembl in SPRET) has Ns insertions in both exons
# SOLUTION: write a Synteny check function (if first exon / if last exon -> check synteny ex. 20/100bp aligned, $
# dont count dashes as indels are more frequent in non-coding regions)
# FIXED (v51 -> synteny check of min 100bp length and up to 200bp -> only exon 2 cloned cose the other one has a huge insertion)

# the inward check should also be 80% rolling at 15bp (<=12/15) - which is a minimal exon size -> include dashes
# test on Anapc13 genome 7 contig 1376713__for exon 2 that survives introny checkpoint (N-term) cose passes 3/10 inward but its completely not intronic
# it also has a frameshift but since its the last exon (Anapc13 has only 2) it gets cloned
# FIXED (v51 synteny check of min 100bp up to 200bp)

# RETRO score issue -> Anapc10 genome1 contig 1096166 -> exon 1 called RETRO cose N-term not intronic and C-term cut as RETRO (but is really MISSING)
# this led to a loss of exon 3 that was also on that contig
# FIXED (thanks to check introny functon in v51)

# Anapc1 genome1 contig 1019892__for exon 15 -> called twice (RETRO at C-term and N anc C-term intronic -> cloned still)
# SOLUTION: first check synteny and only then look for introny and only then for RETRO (at C-term)
# FIXED

# Anapc4 genom5 contigs: 896751__rev and 353__rev -> 353 has more exons and more conserved but hd function measures only overlaps -> wrong contigs picked
# SOLUTION: try to either divide the number by number of exons or better -> just reduce comparison to given exons
# NOT FIXED YET (v52)

# I noticed that N-term syntenic contigs get a "contig NOT SYNTENIC" in the end
# FIXED 

# Anapc1_Pahari_EiJ chr3__rev contig 13 MISSING cose of Ns

# homology check function requires tightening -> Anapc4 genome7 contig 1323785__for exons 13 and 17 are falsely RETRO (min_stretch too short)
# v52 wasnt tested on Anapc4 yet (03_14_2021) -> should be ok though cose min stretch is at 50bp in v52

# reconsider allowing insertions of %3 != 0 -> Anapc4 MASTOMYS contig NW_022196905.1__for exon 26 seems to have an insertion of 18bp but alignment is perturbed by Ns
# and insertion does not fully align with exon 26 from Mm -> ends up being 16bp insertion and exon is eliminated -> whole protein is eliminated (< 90%)
# FIXED -> insertions with Ns are cosidered "big_insertions" in v52 and are not allowed

# reconsider the 50bp minimal stretch in checking introny -> Cdc20 ARVICANTHIS contig NC_047662.1__for exon 10 doesnt pass it at N-term and contig too short to find C-term
# and whole protein is eliminated (<90%)
# FIXED (runs homology check on non-intronic exons)

# v51 can retreive more species of Anapc10 thanks to not falsely picking up one RETRO contig

# v51 Anapc13 has 56% after Gblocks compared to 97% of v45-> cose of Ms misalignment in final MSA and Gd missing
# v51 does better job in finding good contigs for Gd (v45 took a clearly missing contig as exon 2 cose ov 1/7 rule)

# v51 Anapc13 SPRET chr9__for exon 2 has insertion (last exon -> allowed) with Ns -> gets cloned and spoils alignment
# SOLUTION: if statement -> if Ns present in insertion -> not allowed
# DONE in v52

# review Anapc16 -> 2 more species (Mn and Rn) -> goes to >6 LRT M7 vs M8 when v45 was None
# translation looks good -> clearly some non-syn changes in Ha and Rn

# v52 -> Cdc23 genome3 / genome5 / MASTOMYS contig 565196__rev -> exon 13 very divergent introns -> 24/50 matches in C-term and probably similar in N-term
# SOLUTION -> if not-intronic -> run homology check function -> if homologous then call "divergent introns" -> allowed
# should all non-intronic go through homology check? computationally expensive but can rescue poor introns
# ALMOST FIXED
# Cdc23 genome15 contig 209__for exon 15 -> should be divergent introns but its not intronic cose its a small exon and homology check has a 50bp minimum -> try 30bp minimum
# FIXED (30bp min stretch in homology check function)

# allow larger insertions (currently >= 100bp; 02_22_2021) -> >= 171bp (I found 197bp false insertion in Birc5 genome5 984352)
# Cenpe rattus NC_005101.4__for has a 165bp insertion in exon 33 (legitimate)
# DONE

03/19/2021 (v52 -> v53)

# Haus4 -> Pd has a RETRO C-term in one exon (missing) -> whole protein eliminated
# this prevents from false RETRO exons (exon will be cloned even if "might be RETRO" as long as RETRO_score is <0.4)
# Haus4 -> An same exon, same issue -> whole protein eliminated
# -> v53 has "introny = True" whenever even one side is intronic (so RETRO is still called but exon is not missing)
# Haus5 -> Gd is missing exon 1 cose of false RETRO C-term (same issue as Haus5 genome11 78606__rev) 
# FIXED


05/24/2021 (FREEDA_v01)

# Cenpk has multiple STOP codons in Ap, Ay, Pd, Mn, Mo -> clearly there were indels
# Gblocks forces them to make artificial STOPs
# SOLUTION: same as for Cenpc -> force conserved alignment, warning -> remove columns
# (FIXED)

# Cenpc Ay has a STOP codon in the beginning of the final cds post Gblocks
# This STOP codon is NOT legitimate -> 81bp deletion in all Mus species
# Gblocks cut it out in frame causing STOP in Ay but not anywhere else
# SOLUTION: write a function that goes through each gblocks sequence and removes the column
# containing the STOP -> flag it with a warning (maybe even remove the whole sequence?? - rather not)
# otherwise PAML visualizer acts out
# (FIXED)

# Having dashes in the last 30bp is problematic for STOP removal
# SOLUTION: Place the STOP removal function past the elimination of framesfhit?
# (FIXED)

# Cenpl ended up with only 3 species cose of Duplication score (only 3 exons present)
# SOLUTION: disable the Duplication score as a default 
#(FIXED)

# THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH RECOGNISING SOME EXONS (Pahari Anapc11 exon2)
# SOLUTION: forgot to print message and so it didint log but it was effected 
#(FIXED)

# THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH CHECKING INTRONY FUNCTION IN SMALL INTRONS
# Its because sometimes one base pair would be coopted to an exon and pretend to be another exon
# leading to "another exon" introny check issue 
# (FIXED)

#    1)  ISSUE with not finding CD46 C-term in nomLeu3 genome as oppose to gorilla
#           check matches generator module -> does it sort matches before chopping into smaller?
#           -> check on nomleu3 genome CD46 chr5_rev -> compare to gorGor6 chr1_6_for
#            I think the problem is in sorting matches and the fact that two domains in CD46 are quite repeated
#            so broken large contigs do not align well and distant exons 10-13 are not found on later contigs
#            this is speific to exons remote by over 13kb
#            consider increasing suffix and prefix to 15kb? But this will not help with repeated domains
#            even if exon 10 will be found then exon 11 will not be aligned properly
#            WRITE WARNING FOR PROTEINS WITH REPEATED DOMAINS (ex. TACC3, CD46)
#            SAME THING with CD55 -> last exon (10) not found in aligned_CM009238.2__5__for nor aligned_CM009238.2__6__for
#            exon 10 is 20,140 bp away from exon 9 so it should be on contig aligned_CM009238.2__6__for (??? -> check with debugger)
#            possibly exon 10 alone cannot align well with huge gene
#            no point extending 10kb flanking regions to 30kb cose it will increase alignment time for all genes
#            SOLUTION : check debugger to confirm that __6__ is the next contig, let it be -> let user adjust flanks for genes with huge introns
#            FIXED : I checked using debugger -> no match on __6__ suggesting tblastn fault for not picking up this exon
#            VERDICT : Allow user to change flanking region from 10kb default

#    4)  ISSUE with folder_generator:
#           Generating names for folders from genomes names is defective
#           I think its cose "lstrip" that strips "Acomys_Rus -> Acomys_Ru" and "Neomys_lepida" -> "Neomys_lepid"
#           FIXED : this error was not reproduced later (08_21_2021)


#    12) ISSUE with Cenpt missing in spicilegus genome:
#           How come there is no contig with Cenpt coming from Spicilegus genome?
#           SOLUTION : check blast table and compare with spretus
#           VERDICT : no high percentage matches in spicilegus genome -> probably missing from assembly ?

#    5)  ISSUE with exon_finding function:
#           There is a problem in recognising the first exon in Terf2 Apodemus sylv contig LIPJ01013670.1__rev
#           leading hypothesis is that the exon does not fall into any of the "callings"
#           SOLUTION : check if exon intronic on both ends
#           VERDICT : divergent exon -> allow first exons to be divergent (may require further attention and testing)

#    3)  ISSUE with testing exon_finding function:
#           Cenpt Caroli chr19__rev somehow sees only 12 exons (not 13) and final
#           exon count is set as 12 not 13 (even if the right contig picked chr8__rev has 13 exons)
#           its clear that cloner depends on the last contig analysed which is wrong
#           but mainly its a failure of the find_exons function
#           try to get exons dictionary once and then use try/except to avoid KeyError
#           when cloning exons (and potentially having different number)
#           SOLUTION: find_exons doesnt output final exon count anymore (FIXED)

ISSUE : TOO FEW SPECIES TO GET GENE TREE

Final species cloned and aligned (+ original) for CD46 : 3 ['Hs', 'Pb', 'Mu']
['Original alignment: 1176 positions', 'Gblocks alignment:  1125 positions (95 %) in 1 selected block(s)']
Read and write (return) sequences

 Phylip format was created for protein : CD46 

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

ISSUE WITH RAxML sometimes (CENPX primates):

    Partition No Name Provided number 0 has a problem, the number of expected states is 20 the number of states that are present is 17.
    Please go and fix your data!

# NO SOLUTION : Not all amino acids are present in the alignment -> expects 20 "states" for each amino acid
# DID NOTHING


ISSUE -> autodelete proteins from proteins.txt in Data folder if running exon finding (to prevent half-finished runs interfere)

# DONE


#    15)  ISSUE with CD55:
#           Runs blast for forever...
#           Fixed : probably an issue with a blast database, no problem currently

#    0) Figure out how to overlay sequences with microexons -> DONE
#    0) Check Apbb1 protein in rodents -> no 5UTR present in ensembl -> OK
#    0) N-term synteny is not called in non-intronic exons -> why? -> probably cose N-term synteny check not triggered (if indel before first bp)

#    There is something wrong with Zp3 !!!! Ms, Mc, Ha and Mn look completely different -> it seems that all contigs in Zp3 look good but exon 1 is not present in Zp3.fasta -> instead Ms, Mc, Ha and Mn seem to be Zp2 !!!
#    Solution: rerun Zp3 alone -> could be some leftovers from the previous run? Otherwise I dont see how can Zp2 get into Zp3 file -> yes, alone its analyzed properly
#    Izumo1r PAML log file logged 14 species but the alignment shows 16 species! (2 of them are Izumo1)
#    Solution: Go through naming of the alignment files and making copies. Its likely that freeda remebers previous alignments and adds to them. Its them perpetrated to Spaca3 and Astl
#    Lead -> Pd and Gd in Izumo1r are both <90 so they are present in Izumo1r.fasta but Izumo1r_final.fasta has Pd and Gd from Izumo1 !!! that was run alongside
#    Same situation with Izumo1 and Izumo1r -> Izumo1 analyzed with no issues but Izumo1r has Pd and Gd sequence from Izumo1
#    FIXED -> final_species dict in paml launcher was the issue

#    Issue with Incenp -> microexon 10 is absent in cds and exon list but it is still present in the gene (that was alwys the case though)
#    Old input extractor (from Brian) performs Incenp well.
#    SOLUTION : retrace correcting the corrected_cds -> there is a 135bp duplication in its sequence -> FIXED

#    Genome of at least one species contains no matches above the identity threshold used : 30 -> use a lower one -> exiting the pipeline now...
#    I can see that index of nbci datasets downloaded genomes is a bit lower than the one of original genomes (ex. SORICOIDES 14000 entries vs 15000 entries
#    Its possible that Im missing some of the contigs... How to fix that? -> thats what it is, Tomo confirmed that NCBI eliminates some contigs for quality control

#    Nap1l4 -> ...WARNING... : CDS of Nap1l4 in ref species is NOT in frame. (from fasta_reader-py module; it has 2 microexons 1, 14) -> no successful correction of cds
#    However Nap1l4 also is missing exon 13 from the coding sequence (shows up as None in exon calling) -> also misses last bp from exon 12 -> FIXED (microexon correctio function)

#    Try to get Interpro domains for Haus8 -> Q99L00 (see above) -> no Interpro entry -> exception handling -> FIXED

#    Cpne9 -> Mi -> exon 10 has a small repetition that causes exon splitting (10 and 11) and makes total exon number higher -> CDS not in frame -> all exons are a mess
#    Also exon 22 (the one that should not exist) is called exon 23 ???
#    That is no longer true in Ms !! (exon found perfectly well, except that we lost 3bp from exon 10 that aligned with an intron)
#    I should generally double check exon finding in contigs that show deletions -> might be exactly that same issue
#    SOLUTION : fix the exon finding function -> test on Cpne9 Mi contig QGOO01037269.1__rev
#    BETTER SOLUTION : since this predicts the whole sequence to be out of frame -> get an alignment score for each sequence in final alignment (against ref) -> low score -> remove from alignment -> FIXED?
#    Izumo3 -> Mc -> there is 10bp frameshift insertion in last exon (7) -> FREEDA deletes it in "corrected"
#    -> blastp with uniprot Izumo3 shows that this is consistent with known protein seq and that framshift is most likely a seq error (so good job FREEDA)

#    Deal with no matches at threshold (see above) -> FIXED

#    Issue with repetitive domains -> test on Tacc3
#    SOLUTION : Added a single exon mapping checkpoint (test on Haus8 and TACC3) -> Haus8 sometimes passes cds checkpoint in paml launcher and sometimes not -> why? -> different scores -> but used different blast threshold -> test 30
#    Haus8 Gs -> exon 5 has a high score but also 5bp deletion which creates an actual frameshift -> relay on cds checkpoint -> PROTEIN LEVEL CHECKPOINT! -> eliminate species from PAML log as well
#    HOWEVER -> 0.70 cds frameshift will not work cose very rapidly evolving proteins e.g. Izumo1 Gd = 0.5879396984924623 -> also LEAVE UNCORRECTED aligned_final
#    Haus8 Gs -> exon 6 has a low score (0.714) but doesnt have a frameshift, legit???
#    Try to run TACC3 which notoriuosly misaligns cose of repetitive sites -> cds checkpoint is not enough -> try protein checkpoint
#    NO : protein treshold would not help, Izumo1 has as much as 10 aa stretch different between ref and some other species (legit)
#    FINAL SOLUTION : single exon introny check triggered only when poor alignment and penalizes exonic bp in overhangs -> FIXED?

#    Issue with PAML visualization graph -> CDS should be that of the reference species but Mis18bp1 it looks like its the longest's species # I decided that its ok

#    ISSUE with Haus8 -> Gs -> SRMG01015959.1__for -> part of exon 4 does not align (the other one does), there is insertion as well
#                           it created a frameshift at the beginning of the sequence (22aa) present in translated alignment
#                           it might skew the PAML result for Haus8
#                           SOLUTION : drop Gs from Haus8 analysis
#                           Generally Haus8 rat has some very divergent regions but they match the rat uniprot sequence
#                           Haus8 is a weird protein -> possibly many duplications, retrotranspositions
#                           FIXED : single exon introny check for questionably aligned exons

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> get dict for contigs in mouse assembly 104 -> GCA_000001635.9 -> DONE
#    0) ISSUE  -> Add final protein alignment that would correspond to origial protein sequence -> DONE
#    0) QUICK FIX -> proteins with no structure model also dont get protein mapping alignment (Tinf2) -> FIXED


#    0) ESSENTIAL -> Sgo2b last exon (7) is called "None" in exon finder in all contigs -> last bp in cds is missing in gene
#           SOLUTION : Special case for last bp?
#           Update : Same for last exon (13) in Nlrp1a !
#           SOLUTION 2 : Check at input extractor -> if UTR3 == O -> check STOP codon -> if None -> check last exon STOP -> add last bp to gene -> FIXED

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> Prdm9 fails cose of few sequences passing 90% -> cose last exon (10) is huge and 8kb distant -> and there is up to 5000 matches from blast
#           so probably the final threshold of 65 misses some matches in exon 10 and contig ends early -> also plenty of Ns in exon 10 in Mi, Mc etc.
#           Also exon 10 in Prdm9 has duplications that make alignment difficult -> thats why matches and locus not always align (probably main culprit)
#           Main problem -> Mafft seems to fail aligning Prdm9_final.fasta (but Ugene mafft does it with no problem)
#           SOLUTIONS : 1) Nevertheless FREEDA should not crash; 2) Increase matches limit from 40 to 60 and run again; 3) Decrease threshold from 90% to 70% and run again
#           I might need to add single exon length checkpoint -> dash the exon that is double the size of the ref exon -> DONE
#           SOLVED -> exon insertion checkpoint at single exon mapping saved Prdm9 aligmnent and showed rapid evolution of DNA binding repeats in exon 10

#    0) UPGRADE -> Interpro module often overlaps domains (ex. Dmc1 -> 4 overlapping domains)

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> How to deal with non-legit dupliction like Pot1a (Mn) and Pot1b (Ha) - except duplication score

#                   -> also currently even Mm is penalized for dashes -> no sense
#                   -> test on Terf1 (insertion in Mo makes Mm score at 0.93) -> get Mm to 1.0
#                   -> and on Izumo1 (insertion in Rd makes Mm 0.90)
#                   -> reject any sequence below 0.70
#                   -> the issue might be with sequences missing different exons -> test Cenpc, Cenpa etc -> DONE

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> dN/dS ratio is taken wrongly I think -> Rnf187 has 4 NS but dN/dS PAML visualization graph shows
#                                           only one value and the all_matched... dict also shows only one value
#                   SOLUTION : I refactored it, now it shows "recurrently changing sites" indtead of dN/dS ratio

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> if the only protein run has too few species
#                   -> tree fails -> paml fails and all_dict is not formed -> crash -> FIXED

#    3) ISSUE   -> Rnf187 -> is misssing START codon (exon 4 -> 3bp; which is a STOP codon)
#                   -> that transcript does not have a START codon in ensembl ("START lost")
#                   Run PAML on Rnf187 to see how does it affect the pipeline
#                   When running Rnf187 I get "data missing" FATAL ERROR -> and there is no "model_matches_input.txt"
#                   -> why? -> probably cose no START codon (no cds so no comparison with model)
#                   The pipeline will run Rnf187 till the end but it doesnt run from middle

#                           -> it looks like the application went on without issues to the next species
#    0) NOTE -> Cenpb Pd, Mn, Gd are best for working on avoiding "missing" exons when N-tip only is missing

ISSUE -> Reference genome (mouse) lacks gene name Ap2m1 -> but ensembl has it, model was found so whats the problem? -> gene_name issue?

SUGGESTIONS:
#               Use Mo for prediction of sequence accuracy -> compare with NCBI Mo
#               Bioservices 1.8.1 release is ready -> not sure if I need to update from 1.7.12
#               Use pytest -> make TestClass for all tests and use "test_*.py" notation for the testing module
#               Check if NCBI datasets can give uniprot ID -> is it better than pyensembl?
#               To check operation system -> os.uname().sysname -> macOS is "Darwin", linux is "Linux"
#               Figure out how to bypass the need for pyensembl install release -> DONE
#               Use colorlog module to colour the log files
#               Get full gene name list and pass it to GUI -> user can only pick valid gene names
#               CONTINUE TESTING -> allowed first exons to be divergent (08_21_2021) -> but it doesnt work -> N-term needs to pass synteny check first

I am listing this as an answer instead of editing my question because someone might find it useful. If I have made an error please let me know. The problem appears to be with using the BioPython MuscleCommandLine wrapper in this fashion. I was not able to pass any command line options to muscle through the wrapper when calling through a subprocess. My modified code for this is below.

cmd = ['muscle', "-quiet", "-maxiters", "1", "-diags"]

read_list = (SeqRecord(Seq(seq, IUPAC.unambiguous_dna), str(index)) for index, seq in enumerate(grouped_reads_list))

muscle = Popen(cmd, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, universal_newlines=True)

SeqIO.write(read_list, muscle.stdin, "fasta")  # Send sequences to Muscle in FASTA format.
muscle.stdin.close()

align = AlignIO.read(muscle.stdout, 'fasta')  # Capture output from muscle and get it into FASTA format in an object.

muscle.stdout.close()

consensus_read = AlignInfo.SummaryInfo(align).dumb_consensus(threshold=0.6, ambiguous="N", consensus_alpha=IUPAC.ambiguous_dna)
return str(consensus_read)

#    0) NOTE -> coverage value in PAML excel sheet does not include microexons (but its intrinsically a small value)

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> for some reason Phasanidae sometimes generates excel sheet sometimes not;
#                       -> all_matched_adaptive_sites_ref not generated -> cose TLR5 was all empty -> FIXED

#    0) UPGRADE -> Species column in PAML excel sheet should be wider -> make a csv file? -> No, its ok

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> Should all 17 + 1 rodent genomes be used? Some may introduce problematic alignments
#                           and mixed duplications events -> Ha, Pd, Mn, Gd, Ap, Ay -> eliminated Ha

#    0) ESSENTIAL -> test using different aligners - not for user - (Clustal Omega, Muscle)
#                   -> Muscle works now (maxiter 2) -> Cenpx looks identical as mafft, tiny bit faster than mafft
#                   -> test on harder aligments (Cenpc1, Cenpt, Cenpo, Izumo1)
#                   -> muscle (maxiters 2) is faster than mafft (about 30%)
#                                   but fails on partial contigs sometimes (Cenpc1 Gd) -> test on final alignment
#                                   -> muscle often allows parts of actual exons to align in other exons
#                                         (which are often missing or intronic)
#                                         -> generating false RETRO (Haus8 Gd aligned_rev_comp_JADRCF010453847.1__rev)
#                                       -> sometimes fails to call good number of exons Haus8 Rd JADRCG010009828.1__rev
#                                   -> final FREEDA result is identical for mafft and muscle (maxiters 2) for Cenpc1,
#                                                                                       Cenpt, Cenpo and Izumo1
#                                   -> muscle final alignment is very similar to mafft (nearly identical)
#                                   -> but muscle failed to align huge Ptprd -> file not found
#                                               -> handle exception and allow cose generally muscle yields similar
#                                                           results and its about 30% faster
#                   -> clustalw2 made very bad alignments
#                   -> tried Probcons both wrapper and command line -> failed
#                   -> prank takes way too long but try to test it on final alignment

#    2) ISSUE  -> Ptprd-206 -> 5,6,8 microexons and 500kb gene (9bp, 18bp, 12bp)
#               -> Slc8a1-203 -> 5 and 6 ar4 are consecutive microexons (15bp, 18bp)
#                   -> "stich" missing bp in that case as if it was a single microexon
#                  SOLUTION : no good solution for that so far, stiching exons does not help cose of flanking exons
#                           -> but lowering the limit to < 18bp fixed both of these instances

#    4) ISSUE   -> Fix the bioservices issue (Brian) -> in virtual box and pyinstaller the colorlog module
#                   doesnt have "logging" attribute -> it seems python 3.9 is the issue

#    5) ISSUE   -> flanks are as big as the split_large_contigs function -> might be getting same matches
#                      on artificially different contigs??? -> requires testing but probably not (CD46)
#               -> CD46 C-terminus was successfully recovered!!! (so larger flanks help -> need to be
#                           paired with higher thresholds though)
#               -> Try dynamic flanking -> 10kb if gene < 30kb and 30kb if gene > 30kb
#               -> CD46 ended up NOT passing positive selection tests (LRT 2.24) -> try to run it with species tree?
#                               (but the gene tree looks fine)
#               -> try to test flanks 10kb with blastn on CD46 -> NEED TO HAVE CDS IN BLAST INPUT
#                           -> it recovers most exons at 30 t but not all (MULATTA 13 exon missing)

#    6) Use Apbb1 - Ay -> contig LIPJ01008178.1__rev -> exon 11 has one single N and it gets thrown out
#                           -> fix conservatively? -> or more conservative would be to delete that base
#                           -> gBlocks will take care of the frameshift
#                               -> decided not to recover these

#    10)  ISSUE with CD46 primates -> 10-13 exons found only in mulatta -> check blast file
#                       Consider running a blastn (nucleotide) instead of tblastn (protein)
#                                -> tried that, still doesnt find all exons
#                       Consider extending the arms above 10kb to 30kb to check if thats the issue
#                               (probably same as CD55)

#    11) ISSUE with defining parameters:
#           Define a module for tweaking parameters (advanced_parameters.py)
#               - duplication restriction (switches on the duplication score)
#               - flanking arms (default 10kb) -> recommend for large introns (ex. primate default to 30kb)
#               - blast threshold
#               - homology threshold
#               - synteny threshold
#               - coverage threshold
#               - non_ACGT corrector (to mirror CDS position)
#               - pymol residues
#               - input known sites
#                   -> decided against a parameter tweaking module

#    12) ISSUE with BEB results for non-adaptive proteins:
#            Something weird about Bub1 -> lots of >0.90 sites but M7 higher than M8
#            Same with Cenp-W
#            Not sure what the solution is -> I made sure proteins that do not score in M8 vs M7 are not visualized

#    13) ISSUE with the cds_cloner function (requires refactoring) -> hard to solve, probably best left as is
#           Cloner module needs revision to get hamming distance duplication comparison compare
#           the actual duplicated exons and not only the number of exon they carry
#           test on Aurkc Ap
#           test on Nlrp5 Ap BDUI01009531.1__rev

#    14) ISSUE with exon_finding function:
#           Single non_ACGT bases currently lead to whole exon loss
#           SOLUTION: THINK ABOUT FLIPPING non_ACGT INTO CORRESPONDING CDS POSITION (conservative)
#           this could save these exons! -> better woould be to just delete that base and let frameshit be taken care of by Gblocks
#           this function should target only single base non_ACGT and flag these exons -> test on Cxxc1 Ap aligned_rev_comp_BDUI01029349.1__rev exon 7
#               -> decided against it

#    18) ISSUE with running Ap2m1:
#           How come "Contig too short to check C-term synteny 0bp aligned" for contig 81143 in genome11 Ap2m1
#           SOLUTION: Probably connected to exon4 being a 6bp microexon and NOT deleted from exon input but
#           There are 13 exons expected instead of 11 -> exon 12 is skipped for some reason; alignment looks good
#           Also alignment of single exons from exon 7 is messed up (linux default file order problem again?)
#           early STOP remover function worked well -> post trimming it was easier to align hence difference in "no_STOP" alignment length
#           but since last 4 single exons were aligned poorly, the stop codons were missing/were displaced in other species
#               -> not sure what that was about but it looks good now (01/03/2022)
