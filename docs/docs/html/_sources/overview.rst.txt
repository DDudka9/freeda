Overview
========

FREEDA (Finder of Rapidly Evolving Exons in Diverse Assemblies) is a Python built end-to-end
automated pipeline to detect positive selection, created for experimental cell biologists 
without training in computational biology and molecular evolution.

- Source code: `https://github.com/DDudka9/freeda <https://github.com/DDudka9/freeda>`_
- Requirements:
	- Operating systems compatible:
		- MacOS: Mojave, Big Sur, Monterrey and Ventura (Apple Silicon must have Rosetta installed)
		- Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
		- Windows (currently through VirtualBox only)
	- Disc space:
		- min 100 GB per taxon e.g. primates (we recommend using a hard drive with 500GB space)
	- Stable Internet connection
