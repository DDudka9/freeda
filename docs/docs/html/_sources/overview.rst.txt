Overview
========

FREEDA (Finder of Rapidly Evolving Exons in De novo Assemblies) is a Python built end-to-end 
automated pipeline to detect positive selection, created for experimental cell biologists 
without training in computational biology and molecular evolution.

		- Linux Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
		- Windows and M1/M2-chip MacOS (currently through VirtualBox only)
	- Disc space:
		- min 100 GB per taxon e.g. primates (we recommend using a hard drive with 500GB space)
	- Internet connection
