Installation
============

Mac
---

The easiest way to install FREEDA is to download the prepackaged versions available on the GitHub Releases page. (INSERT LINK) After downloading, just double-click the Mac .app file to run FREEDA.

Linux
-----

A prepackaged version of FREEDA is available for Linux. Download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page. Once you have, FREEDA is run from the command line. To do so, open a terminal either by pressing CTRL + ALT + t or by clicking on it in the Applications menu. Then, navigate to the folder where FREEDA was downloaded, allow it to be executed, and run it. For example, if FREEDA was downloaded to the Downloads folder:
.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Downloads
    chmod +x freeda
    ./freeda

Replacing ``~/Downloads`` with your download location (note that path names are case sensitive).

After the first time, FREEDA can be run the same way, omitting the ``chmod...`` command.

Windows
-------

FREEDA is not available for Windows. However, it is possible to run FREEDA from a virtual machine running Linux inside a Windows computer. For more information, see :ref:`Setting Up a Virtual Machine <virtual machine anchor>`.
