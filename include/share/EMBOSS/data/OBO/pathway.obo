Major branches are headache, stupor and coma, dementia, seizure, sleep disorders, trauma, infections, neoplasms, neuro-ophthalmology, movement disorders, demyelinating diseases, spinal cord disorders, and disorders of peripheral nerves, muscle and neuromuscular junctions. Many mental illnesses are believed to be neurological disorders of the central nervous system, but they are classified separately. They are not traditionally listed as neurological diseases because their causes are not definitely determined as biological, although there are good reasons to suspect that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have neuro-chemical causes."

def: "Cannabinoids are a class of rather diverse chemical compounds of which some, like endocannabinoids are naturally produced by the body in humans and other animals, while others are found in plants or are synthesized. Signaling is mediated by the cannabinoid receptors that are G protein coupled (GPCR) receptors. The endogenous cannabinoids are lipids and the signaling route is referred to as retrograde as it  travels 'backwards' from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell."

Lamivudine is a a reverse transcriptase enzyme inhibitor used for the treatment of HIV typ1 and 2 and Hepatitis B. Genetic variations can cause differences in the response of the organism to the drug." [PharmGKB:http\://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA165860384]

name: toxin and toxicant response pathway
def: "The responses triggered by exposure to a toxin or a toxicant, a poisonous substance naturally produced by an organism or made by humans, respectively. A toxicant can be a poison, such as a pesticide. It can also be a compound for use in certain applications, the exposure to which, if in high enough doses, may be toxic. Inflammatory responses, various types of cell death, changes in gene and protein expression can be induced upon exposure." [Wikipedia:https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin]

name: carbon nanotube response pathway
def: "A pathway triggered by exposure to carbon nanotube (CNT), an allotrope of carbon of the fullerene structural family. CNTs have a very broad range of applications but can also exert toxic effects. Pulmonary toxicity possibly via reactive oxygen species, inhibition of potassium channels and DNA repair are some of the potential mechanisms of CNT genotoxicity. Various forms of cell death and inflammatory responses are triggered in response to CNT." [PubMed:PMID\: 23770455\, 22720979\,  23751779]

Nano-TiO2 has a broad range of applications but studies indicate that under conditions of long and high dose exposure, it can exert cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. Nano-TiO2 has been shown to induce inflammation, oxidative stress and MAP kinase activity." [PubMed:PMID\: 23380242]
