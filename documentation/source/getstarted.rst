	(INSERT LINK) 
2. Double-click the .app file to run FREEDA (it might take a couple of minutes to load)

Linux
-----

1. Download the latest Linux release from the GitHub Releases page: 
	(INSERT LINK) 
2. Run FREEDA from the command line. To do so, open a terminal either by pressing CTRL + ALT + t or by clicking on it in the Applications menu. 
3. Navigate to the folder where FREEDA was downloaded, allow it to be executed, and run it. 

For example, if FREEDA was downloaded to the Downloads folder copy and enter commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd ~/Downloads
    chmod +x freeda
    ./freeda

Otherwise replace ``~/Downloads`` with your download location (path names are case sensitive).

After the first time, FREEDA can be run the same way, omitting the ``chmod...`` command.

Windows
-------

FREEDA is not available for Windows. However, it is possible to run FREEDA from a virtual machine running Linux inside a Windows computer. For more information, see :ref:`Setting Up a Virtual Machine <virtual machine anchor>`.
